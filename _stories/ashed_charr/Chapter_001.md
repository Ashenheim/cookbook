It was night in the Black Citadel, yet everyone was busy. Hammers forcing steel into weaponry, the Adamant Guard patrolling with their loud steps and Charr spending their free time in the bars.

There was one peculiar black Charr by the name of Muzzles Ashmane, sitting absent-minded at the bar with a few empty bottles around him, he had thick leather straps around his chest, ending up in a decorated heavy looking kilt. The barkeeper stared at him and gave him a nudge and grumbled _“Don’t you have something better to do?”_ The black Charr grumbled and pulled himself up, his face contoured in pain and anger and he merely asked for another drink.


The barkeeper sighed, and brought another bottle of brandy. The barkeeper scuffled away as Muzzles tipped the bottle to his lips, and suddenly he felt a slap on his back and he coughed up what he tried to drink.

He looked back, and saw his partner at the Fahrar and drinking buddy and he grunted. _“Yo Muzzly!”_ she shouted loudly in his ears. He looked annoyed at her, with bright yellow fur, blue piercing eyes and a devious grin spread on her face. Over the years he began to grew fond of her, maybe she was loud but always a good laugh in cheering him up. Surprisingly a fine thief, always having to be careful around her with his valuables. Her name was Narley, though she had the habit to urge him to call her Narls. Muzzles always teased her by calling her Snarls which would ended up with one.

He handed over his bottle and wanted to order another bottle but Narley pushed down his arm. _“I think you had enough for the night, it’s your turn tomorrow cleaning after the cubs.. how did your mission go?”_ she asked skittish.
He forced his face into a grin, glad the alcohol was starting to help on that. _“Mission went fine, why else you think I am here.”_ as he placed his hand tight on his pocket feeling his payment was still there. They sat beside each other, he faced forward while he could hear her next to him drink loudly and his mind went back again a few months in time.

Muzzles woke up and stretched, finding something amiss in the empty side of his bedding. He clothed himself, when suddenly an armoured Charr hurried in, weapon drawn but quickly pulled back at the sight of only Muzzles. _“You! Where is your mate?”_ he growled angrily. Muzzles stared confused at the Charr, having just woke up and wondering the same thing, he stepped forward and asked wit his skruffy voice _“What’s the meaning of this?”_. The Charr looked suspicious at him and responded _“Your sister’s warband including your mate left the Black Citadel, we are suspecting they joined forces with the Flame Legion.”_.

His mind went blank, and stood in shock. He asked him quietly to leave. He did, and he hurried over to his armour and pulled the tight leather and equipped his belt with his pistol, explosive bombs and grenades. He turned to his shield and strapped it on his back and hurried outside running on all fours around the Citadel.

The visited his sisters place first, found it in a mess as if someone has left in a hurry. He walked towards a bowl of soup, it smelled fresh but was cold. He gave a sip and recognised his sisters cooking and pondered. He shook his head and left to visit barracks, tents and places he knew her warband lived, saw them all stripped from their belongings, as if they truly left.. Unlike his sister.

He stepped outside, meeting the burning sun of the morning glow and walked and question everyone he could find. All confirming the same story. They all left without orders. Without telling him where they went. Furious he roared, feeling betrayed by the ones he cared for.
