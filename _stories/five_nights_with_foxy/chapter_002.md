Mike pulled his car into one of the few available parking spots in the pizzeria's parking lot. The countless number of mini-vans indicated that a birthday party was currently underway.  
He hadn't been able to think of anything other than what happened the previous night for the entire day. Not so much to do with the murderous robots, but more with Foxy. As hard as he tried, the security guard helplessly replayed their encounter over and over again in his head. It got so bad, Mike decided to come into work early. He justified it in his head by telling himself that he needed to make defensive preparations for the animatronics.  
This was, of course, an utter lie. With the trick Foxy had shown him, the upcoming nights seemed like they'd be a breeze. He would be able to save power and securely sit inside his office with the doors separating himself from Freddy's band.  
Mike pushed open one of the twin glass doors into the pizzeria. He was greeted with an intense blast of hot air and loud noise. Both of which were results of the ongoing riot of a birthday party. A pair of screaming kids ran past him, throwing slices of pizza at each other.  
"Mike! Good to see ya!" The owner, Freddy, yelled across the room. He cautiously made his way to the security guard, skillfully navigating the sea of children, "What brings you here at this time? Your shift doesn't start for another couple of hours."  
"I, uh" Mike paused, "I came to make some preparations for tonight. Can't be too careful with those robots." He forced out a laugh.  
"I hear ya," Freddy laughed with him. He turned and stared at the animatronic band, performing their classic song "Ain't No Party Like a Pizza Party". After a brief shudder, he turned back to Mike, "Well let me know if you need anything!"  
"I will, thanks."

Mike made his way through the party, towards the doorway marked "Pirate's Cove". A few kids from the party were hanging around inside, two of them pretending to sword fight. The other two were on the stage, examining Foxy close up.  
"Hey look!" One of them said, "His ear is loose!". He promptly reached up and with a quick pull, ripped off one of the fox's ears, much to Mike's dismay.  
"Woah woah woah! Stop that!" Mike interrupted, startling the children. He threw aside his backpack and quickly grabbed the pirate's ear out of the child's hand, "You should know better than to damage something that doesn't belong to you." Mike said sternly, trying to justify his outburst.  
"Whatever grandpa, he was ugly to start. No need to ruin our fun." One of kids muttered, climbing off of the stage and returning to the main party. The other three followed him, leaving Foxy and Mike alone.  
After double checking that the coast was clear, Mike quickly scrambled onto the stage.  
"You alright?" He whispered into Foxy's un-broken ear. He inspected the hole where his other ear had been, "That looks like it hurts."  
Mike remembered that Foxy wasn't allowed to move during the day. Or couldn't. He still wasn't sure on that.  
"Oh, right. Can't talk. Sorry 'bout that." Mike whispered as he continued to peer into the hole.  
"It looks like I'll be able to just clip it back in. But it's gonna hurt."  
Mike placed the ear over the hole and quickly jammed it back into place. Despite the obvious pain it must have inflicted, Foxy managed to maintain his complexion, aside from a muffled grunt and a bit of shaking.  
"Sorry sorry sorr-!"  
"Thank you." Foxy said quietly, interrupting Mike's apologies. The fox quickly returned back to his frozen pose before anyone could see him move. Mike let out a sigh and smiled, "Don't mention it.".  
Mike picked up his backpack again and turned to head to his office.  
"I'll see you later,"

An alarm on Mike's phone went off, signaling that it was midnight, and that the animatronics were active. Mike picked up the video panel and began watching the band.

_What?! The duck's already gone?!_

He quickly scanned the other rooms for the missing robot. He changed to the kitchen, holding his ear close to the panel. The sound of clanging pans indicated that the duck was approaching him faster than he had anticipated. He quickly stood up and opened the metal box on the wall, revealing a breaker switch. Mimicking Foxy, Mike grabbed it and tried to pull it down. After a few seconds of struggle, he realized it was stuck.  
"Oh shit oh shit. It can't be jammed. Not right now." He muttered out loud. His panic was interrupted by sound of scraping metal. Mike hesitantly peered down the east hallway. Chica was slowly walking towards him, dragging one of her wings against the wall. Her eyes locked with his, striking fear and panic into Mike.  
The security guard returned to his office quickly and began looking for something to defend himself with. Before he could grab anything off of the desk, he was thrown back into chair by the large duck. Mike's breath caught in this throat, stifling a scream. Chica moved her face close to his, inspecting him. She reached one of her wings up to his face and pressed it against his cheek. The sharp, exposed metal on her wing dug into his skin, drawing blood. Mike let out a quiet whimper, feeling it cut deeper and deeper. Soon the tip of the duck's wing was coated in blood.  
"**HEY.** That's my kill." A familiar voice boomed. Foxy's.  
"Stay out of this, fox." Chica snapped, her voice low and raucous.  
Mike opened one of his eyes slowly, seeing Foxy stand in the doorway, pressing his hook against Chica's throat.  
"This one crushed my foot under the door. I want to do the same to his throat." The pirate explained, his words dripping with anger and violence. The duck backed away from Mike.  
"Fine." Chica said, "But don't expect any favors from me in the future. You know how Freddy gets."  
Foxy nodded and waited for Chica to return back into the dark hallway. He quickly walked over to the breaker switch and swiped it down with impossible ease. The large metal doors swung down, sealing them in the office again.  
"Are you alright?" Foxy asked, quickly turning his attention to Mike. He nodded, moving a hand up to his face to feel the damage. A stream of blood slowly poured out of the gash on his cheek.  
"Sorry if I scared you just then," Foxy apologized, "Violence is the only way to get through to them sometimes"  
"It's okay" Mike smiled, wiping some of his blood on the chair's arm. Foxy pulled up a stool next to the security guard and took a close look at his injury. He raised his hand and hesitated  
"Can I…get a better look at it?" He asked, not wanting to touch Mike without permission. Mike nodded.  
The pirate gently placed his paw on Mike's head and turned it towards the office lamp.  
"That looks pretty deep," He inspected, "I think we should patch it up."  
Foxy's words went over Mike's head. He was too distracted with Foxy's paw on his un-gashed cheek. Despite covering metal, his fur felt incredibly real. Mike could subtly feel heat from the paw. He felt something warm on his other cheek. He turned his head and realized it was Foxy's breath. Mike stiffened up, their faces inches apart.  
"Mike?" Foxy said, dragging him back to earth.  
"W-what?"  
"You zoned out on me." Foxy explained, "I said we should bandage your wound up."  
Mike quickly remembered that his face was bleeding, "Oh…right. Yeah."  
Foxy stood up and looked around the small office. He turned his back to Mike and began rooting through the desk and it's drawers. Mike took the opportunity to examine the Fox's back. Patches of fur had been torn off in various places, exposing some metal and wires. Despite being a robot, Mike noticed Foxy's back was rather…muscular. Upon closer inspection, so too were his arms.  
Mike's eyes unintentionally sank lower down Foxy's form and landed on his tail. The pirate seemed to idly sway it back and forth. As with his back, a few small patches of fur were missing. The tail made a quick flicking motion, snapping Mike out of his trance. He suddenly realized Foxy was staring at him over his shoulder.  
"I was, uh, just staring at your, tail." Mike stammered. Foxy chuckled and returned back to looking for a make-shift bandage.  
"Aha!" He cheered, interrupting Mike's intense blushing, "We could use this to stop the bleeding!"  
He turned around and presented Mike with one of the children's drawings off of the wall and a roll of tape.  
"This was drawn on a napkin." Foxy explained. He sat back down on his stool, and quickly folded the napkin into a rectangle long enough to cover the injury, "This might sting a bit."  
Foxy reached behind him and grabbed his tail, giving the tip to Mike, "Here, you can squeeze this while I work."  
Mike hesitantly grabbed it and prepared for the aforementioned stinging. Foxy carefully placed the napkin against Mike's cheek, covering the gash perfectly. Mike clenched his teeth and squeezed Foxy's tail tightly at the searing pain. The fox worked his paws quickly and ripped off a strip of tape with his hook. Mike was momentarily distracted from the pain when he felt Foxy's warm breath on his cheek again. He relaxed a bit. Foxy gently taped the napkin in place twice. The blood failed to leak through it, proving Foxy's idea successful.  
"Aaaand, finished." He announced, leaning back from Mike's face.  
The security guard gently patted the bandage, "Wow. Thanks."  
"You can let go of my tail now." Foxy laughed.  
Mike blushed intensely again, releasing his tight grip.  
"Sorry."  
"It's alright," He smiled, un-matting the fur on his tail. When he finished he looked back at Mike and realized there was still a noticeable amount of blood that had run down his neck and cheek. He grabbed another drawing off of the wall, "Here, let me wipe that off for you."  
The fox moved his face close to Mike's once again, his breath a welcoming feeling against his skin. Foxy began gently wiping up the remaining blood.  
"Thanks…again." Mike said quietly.  
"It's no problem…again." He chuckled, "I'm sure you can repay somehow."  
Mike paused for moment.  
He quickly turned his face to the pirate's and darted forward, pressing his lips against Foxy's. He closed his eyes tightly, afraid of how he might react. Mike could feel Foxy tense up, naturally surprised at the security guard's action. After a moment of tense silence, he relaxed and pressed into the kiss. The fox wrapped his arms around Mike and pulled him closer. His soft fur pressed against his skin, allowing Mike to relax and enjoy the moment.  
After holding the kiss for a few more seconds they separated, both out of breath.  
"Wow…" Foxy said breathlessly.  
"Yeah…"  
The sat in the afterglow, both gathering their breath and thoughts.  
An alarm on Mike's phone went off, interrupting the moment. He quickly turned it off.  
"I guess that means I should get into position."  
"Y-yeah."  
Foxy slowly stood up. After a quick pause, he held out his paw, "I'll walk you back again? If you want?"  
"Y-yeah. I'd like that a lot."

"I never got to thank you properly for saving my ear earlier." Foxy said, guiding Mike through the dark hallways.  
"Oh yeah…" Mike replied, gripping Foxy's hand tightly.  
"I don't want to imagine what they would have done with it." Foxy laughed.  
The two entered Pirate's Cove, it's light welcoming Mike back.  
They slowly walked to the stage together.  
"So…I guess I'll see you tomorrow?" Foxy asked, sitting on the stage.  
Mike nodded.  
"Alright." He smiled.  
"Thanks…for everything." Mike said, adjusting his make-shift bandage.  
"Don't mention it." Foxy climbed into the stage.  
Mike turned to the door, and paused.

"See you tomorrow, Foxy."
