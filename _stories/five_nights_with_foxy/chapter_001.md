"Hiya! Welcome to Freddy Frazbear's Pizza!" A stout middle aged man boomed at the person entering his restaurant.
"Uh, hey." Mike Schmidt greeted him, looking around the large pizzeria. Rows upon rows of tables filled the room, each bearing the scars from the previous birthday party to pass through. On the other side of the room stood what Mike assumed was the main attraction, the stage. It hosted the members of an animatronic band. A duck, rabbit and a bear.
The owner put down a plate of half eaten pizza and approached Mike, "The name's Freddy, what can I do for ya?"
"I'm here about the ad you put out." Mike explained, pulling out this week's classifieds,"you're looking for a security man?"
"I see!" He beamed, smiling, "then you're hired! I'll introduce ya to the band!".
"R-really? Alright!" Mike nodded. Freddy led him to the stage.
"This here's what draws the kids in." He explained, gesturing to the group of fluffy robots, "we got, Bonny Bunny, Chica the duck and last but not least, Freddy Frazbear!"
"So I guess they sing and dance?"
"That's right!" He said, patting Freddy's head almost cautiously.
"So are these the only ones?"
"We got one more over here in Pirate's Cove." He replied, leading Mike into the next room. The door opened into a large island-themed room. Plastic palm trees and wooden benches surrounded another stage.
"And this here is Foxy." Freddy pointed to a large animatronic red fox with an eye patch and a hook for a hand. Mike climbed onto the stage to get a better look. He reached a hand out and brushed Foxy's arm.
"It feels almost real." Mike said.
"Yeah he's an ugly fucker, huh? Freddy laughed. Mike looked closely at the fox's face. The amount of detail was impressive. It's eye seemed almost real, shining a deep blue.
"I think he's kinda cute." Mike smiled. He climbed off of the stage, "alright, is there anything else I should know before I start?"
"Well…" The owner fell silent, "Yeah. "

Mike's hands gripped onto the video panel tightly, a drop of sweat dripping onto the screen. He quickly wiped it off, feeling his breath quicken with even second. He had assumed Freddy was only joking when he said the robots moved at night. But the proof was in front of him. He changed channels again, this time to 5, backstage.

"Holy shit!" He yelled, seeing something move.

_Which one was that…the rabbit? The duck?_

He changed channels again, this time to 1C, "Pirates Cove…" he read out loud, "Where's the fox?".
Mike's heart jumped into his throat. Changing channels to the West Hallway, his question was quickly answered. The large fox was bounding down the hallway towards his office. Mike leapt up from his seat and slammed his hand onto the button marked "DOOR". He closed his eyes tightly, too scared to open them. The door fell to the ground with loud bang.
"**AH! MY FOOT**!" Someone yelled. Mike's eyes shot open, looking at the solid metal door before him. He looked at the floor and saw a large red paw trapped. Instinct kicked in and made him release his hand from the red button. The door retracted into the roof once again, revealing the large red pirate-fox in the doorway.
"T-thank you." It whimpered, it's voice soft and raspy. It lifted it's foot to get a better look at the damage, "ouch, that sure did a number to it."
The robot looked around the small office, and spotted a free stool. "Could you pass me that?"
Mike froze up, sinking further into his chair.
"Please don't kill me." He slowly pushed the chair over to hurt fox.
"I'm not gonna kill you. Relax. That ain't my thing." He explained, waving his hook in the air, "My name's Foxy. Foxy the Pirate."
He held out a large paw. Mike slowly reached out and shook it.
"M-Mik-" He cut himself off, glancing at the video panel on the floor. A large yellow duck ran past one of the cameras. The east hallway.
"oh shit oh shit, it's coming." the security guard scrambled out of his seat for the button.
"Relax I got this." Foxy interrupted. He hopped off the stool and opened a metal box on the wall containing a large breaker switch, "the trick is to flip this down."
He hit it with his hook. The large metal doors suddenly swung down, sealing them the small office.
"And there ya go! The last security guard taught me that one."
Mike relaxed a bit, feeling safer despite being trapped in a small room with a living animatronic fox.
"T-thanks." Mike stammered.
"No problem, Mike was it?" Foxy asked. Mike nodded nervously, "sorry to startle you, I heard you yell and thought I'd check if one of the others got to you."
He sat back down on the stool and leaned his back against the wall. Mike started breathing heavily, struggling to hide his fear from the fox.
"Hey, are you alright?" The pirate sat up, "You look mighty pale."
Foxy stood up and moved closer to the new security guard, placing his paw on his forehead. He held it there for a second. Mike felt his soft, almost warm, fur brush against his skin. As scared as he was, he felt himself uncontrollably relax a bit.
"Y-yeah, I'm okay." He said shakily, sitting up in the seat, "thank you again for the shutting the door. I was running low on power."
"Don't mention it. It was the least I could do since you let the door off my foot." He smiled, "Speaking of which…"
Foxy held up his foot with his hook. A large dent was left half way down.
"That looks painful…" Mike said bluntly, "if you can, y'know, feel it."
"I may be made of metal but I still feel things like you." The large fox explained, curiously poking the dent. A sudden sting of pain shot up his leg, making him whimper.
"Woah, careful there." Mike quickly intervened, moving the fox's hand away from his foot, "does it hurt when you put weight on it?"
"Y-yeah?" Foxy said, sitting back, letting the security guard get a better look.
"Here," Mike pulled his scarf off of a rack behind him. He quickly fashioned it into a bandage and carefully wrapped it around the robot's foot, "how's that?"
"It's…" He slowly placed it on the floor and stood up, "wow, it's a lot better. Thank you."
"Don't mention it I guess." Mike stammered. He looked up at the large red fox, still struggling to believe what had became of the night.
He looked at the fox's eye again. It seemed different now…deeper. Foxy glanced at Mike and caught him staring. He smiled, making him look away.

_Am I…blushing?!_

An alarm suddenly went off on Mike's phone.
"Oh, that means it 6am." he explained, turning it off.
"Wow morning came quickly." Foxy laughed, flipping the breaking back up, opening up the doors, "don't worry, the others will be back in their spots by now. They won't move."
"A-alright." Mike nodded, glancing into the dimly hallway.
"I gotta get back to pirat-" the large red fox stopped in the doorway, seeing how nervous Mike was.
He held out his paw, "here, I'll walk you to the front."

The duo entered the tropical themed room once again. Sunlight shined in from some windows on the roof, a welcoming sight to Mike.
"Alright, this is my stop. We got a party at 7 so I should probably get into place." Foxy explained, letting go of Mike's hand.
"Oh…okay." Mike said, looking around, half expecting a giant yellow duck to pop out of somewhere, "you know, you didn't have to hold my hand the whole time." He laughed.
"You were gripping pretty hard to it" he laughed with him, climbing onto the stage.
"Y'know…most guards quit after the first night." Foxy paused, idly playing with his hook, "will I get to see you again?"
Mike paused, not having considered the option of staying.
"You know what, you don't have to decide right now." He interrupted the train of thought, "the entrance is right through there."
"A-alright…" Mike said, "thanks…for everything."

Mike pushed the doors to Freddy Frazbear's Pizza open and stepped out onto the parking lot.
"Ah! Mike." Freddy beamed, stepping out of his car, "I had a good feeling about you! I knew you'd make it!"
The owner walked up to him, "now listen, I know what you saw can be pretty jarring to a person but the robots aren't as dangerous as they look. But if you quit, I understand."
"Don't worry, I'm not gonna quit." Mike explained
"Really?" Freddy blurted out, "You aren't afraid of the robots?"
"Not really, I don't think they're all that bad." Mike smiled, "see ya tomorrow, Mr. F"
Mike climbed into his car and started the engine.

_See you tomorrow, Foxy._
